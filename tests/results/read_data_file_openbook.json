Suspicious of the general adulation of Einstein, Lenard became a prominent skeptic of relativity and of Einstein's theories generally; he did not, however, dispute Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect. Lenard received the 1905 Nobel Prize for Physics in recognition of this work. Lenard was the first person to study what has been termed the \"Lenard effect\" in 1892. This is the separation of electric charges accompanying the aerodynamic breakup of water drops. It is also known as spray electrification or the waterfall effect. He conducted studies on the size and shape distributions of raindrops and",

For instance, the rainfall in Bauchi state ranges between per annum in the south and only per annum in the extreme north. This pattern is because in the West Africa sub-region, rains generally come from the south as they are carried by the southwesterlies. There is therefore a progressive dryness towards the north, culminating in the desert condition in the far north. So also is the case in Bauchi state. Consequently, rains start earlier in the southern part of the state, where rain is heaviest and lasts",
